📊 Dataset Information

Using the Heart Disease UCI dataset with the following features:
- Demographics: Age, Sex
- Clinical Measurements: Chest Pain Type, Resting BP, Cholesterol
- Diagnostic Tests: ECG Results, Exercise-induced Angina
- Target: Cardiovascular Disease Presence (0/1)

🧪 Model Performance

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Random Forest | 87.3% | 0.89 | 0.85 | 0.87 |
| Logistic Regression | 84.6% | 0.86 | 0.83 | 0.84 |
| SVM | 82.1% | 0.84 | 0.80 | 0.82 |

📈 Key Insights

1. Age Factor: Risk increases significantly after age 50
2. Gender Patterns: Males show higher risk in younger age groups
3. Clinical Indicators: Chest pain type and exercise-induced angina are strong predictors
4. Cholesterol Impact: Non-linear relationship with risk levels

🎯 Business Impact

- Early Detection: 87% accuracy in identifying high-risk patients
- Cost Reduction: Preventive care recommendations reduce emergency visits
- Patient Outcomes: Improved treatment planning through risk stratification
- Healthcare Efficiency: Automated screening saves clinical time

🚀 Future Enhancements

1. Integration with Electronic Health Records (EHR)
2. Real-time monitoring dashboard
3. Advanced deep learning models
4. Multi-disease risk assessment
5. Mobile app development
